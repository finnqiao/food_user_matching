       "  'chef-info': '\"People who love to eat are always the best people\" ~ Julia Child\\r\\n\\r\\nSalam! My love for cooking started at a young age in my motherland of Iran, when I used to watch my mom cook for our family of six and endless more guests! She taught me to cook with passion and educate myself about the healing power of food and herbs. To this day, healthy eating habits play an important role in my cooking and personal lifestyle. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a beautiful tradition at home of making our own delicate pastries for the Persian New Year, Nowruz, marking the first day of Spring. Family and friends simply loved it, and we loved spreading the joy! I’ve had the chance to explore and share my cooking and baking skills since then. When I was 16, I volunteered to help raise money by hand-making high quality sweets and treats for charities and non-profit organizations. I always enjoyed doing such projects alongside my studies and work, especially for a good cause. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy style of cooking is influenced as much by my Persian roots as my travels in other countries. I’ve had the pleasure of exploring different cuisines during trips across Europe, such as in Paris where I took classes at the Cordon Bleu. I believe travel, people and food open doors to different cultures and I truly feel lucky to be able to experience that endless journey of discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiving in San Francisco has been yet another fantastic experience. With a professional background in computer Eng. and business, I’ve worked with high tech startups here in the Bay Area, mainly dealing with technology gadgets like augmented reality glasses and product management. I enjoy extensive knowledge about branding and advertising from my time working and studying in Dubai, a global melting pot, which also opened many doors for me to Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m excited above all to share the fruits of my global cooking adventures with you, including unique culinary gems of my beloved Iran. \\r\\n\\r\\nNoosh e joon. Enjoy. Bon appetit. Sahtein  \\r\\n\\r\\nSeti Shay \\r\\nPetite girl with a big appetite.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow my journey on IG: @setistable',\n",

I was working as an engineer for French Company on weekdays and \\r\\nFreelance Nature explorer on weekends before I moved to the States. Food was always one of the main topics for me and I've done some research about Northern Iranian cuisine, as my grandparents come from that part of the country. \\r\\nWell, in my idea the Gilaki/Caspian cuisine is one of the most unique cuisines in the whole Middle East. Northern Iran is a special region naturally, located at the south of the biggest lake in the world the Caspian Sea and at the north of Albert mountain range. The region is covered with dense forests, sorounded by snow covered mountains and impressive sea shores. Northern Iran's lush, humid climate allows crops such as rice, tea, pomegranate and citrus to flourish. Parsley, cilantro, mint, dill and spinach are indispensable ingredients used in most all cooking same as Nuts. Pomegranates, as well as the thick-skinned, sour citrus fruit Narenj, are reduced down to make tart, concentrated molasses that impart bright flavor to Gilaki dishes.\\r\\nI recently finished the video shooting part of an amazing cooking documentary project about Gilaki cuisine.

I always loved it, but I knew there were limits to what we had available in the US. After reading Anthony Bourdain's 'A Cook's Tour,' I knew I had to do something crazy if I really wanted to expand my horizons - it was a now or never moment. \\r\\n\\r\\nI worked in tech to pay the bills, but in retrospect I realize now that it was always a front for my real intentions. In between bingeing on some of the most amazing food I've ever eaten, I discovered real ramen and fell in love all over again. \\r\\n\\r\\nThough sushi is, and always will be my true love, it wasn't sustainable and ramen like a warm fuzzy pork belly blanket was always there to support and comfort me during those frigid lulls between paychecks until I could get my next sushi fix.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCountless food-epiphanies later, I'm back in SF with a burning passion for delicious food, but still feeling like I've only begun to scratch the surface of what I experienced in Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can read more about my favorite meals and life in Japan at: \\r\\n\\r\\nwww.noodleinhaystack.com \\r\\n\\r\\nand follow & review us here:\\r\\n\\r\\ninstagram.com/noodleinhaystack\\r\\nfacebook.com/noodleinhaystack\\r\\nyelp.com/biz/noodle-in-a-haystack-san-francisco\",\n",
