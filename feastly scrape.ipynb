I started working as a cook at Golestankids (Center for Language Immersion and Cultural Education) in Berkeley and worked for two years. I am also a part time  cooking teacher for Golestankids after school program. I have a bachelor degree in Material Engineering. I was working as an engineer for French Company on weekdays and \\r\\nFreelance Nature explorer on weekends before I moved to the States. Food was always one of the main topics for me and I've done some research about Northern Iranian cuisine, as my grandparents come from that part of the country. \\r\\nWell, in my idea the Gilaki/Caspian cuisine is one of the most unique cuisines in the whole Middle East. Northern Iran is a special region naturally, located at the south of the biggest lake in the world the Caspian Sea and at the north of Albert mountain range. The region is covered with dense forests, sorounded by snow covered mountains and impressive sea shores. Northern Iran's lush, humid climate allows crops such as rice, tea, pomegranate and citrus to flourish. Parsley, cilantro, mint, dill and spinach are indispensable ingredients used in most all cooking same as Nuts. Pomegranates, as well as the thick-skinned, sour citrus fruit Narenj, are reduced down to make tart, concentrated molasses that impart bright flavor to Gilaki dishes.\\r\\nI recently finished the video shooting part of an amazing cooking documentary project about Gilaki cuisine. Based on that project I started a series of pop-up events and I will be so pleased to have the chance to be your host.\",\n",

That adventure turned into a career of working his way through every position in the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in San Francisco, Geoff has worked numerous restaurant openings including Pläj with Executive Chef Roberth Sundell, rated among the top 100 restaurants in the Bay Area by SF Chronicle.

Small Plate Simit and Yogurt Butter Every neighborhood in Istanbul will have a ‘cig kofte’ (raw meatball) spot where you will see a strong, husky mustached man knead lamb with bulgur and spices into delicious morsels of lamb tartar. Our approach is more delicate. We serve our tartare with a mint ‘ayran ashi’ which literally translates to ‘yogurt meal’, it’s our sauce.

Dessert Dessert, Georgian Honey Cake We made it a custom to start our meals with simit and finish them with a home made liqueur.

It began early on in his parent’s garden, fishing in the creek behind the house and having full reign to play in the kitchen. Geoff got his first taste of the culinary life at 12, helping with chocolate dipped strawberries and washing dishes on Valentine’s Day at a restaurant where his older brother worked. That adventure turned into a career of working his way through every position in the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in San Francisco, Geoff has worked numerous restaurant openings including Pläj with Executive Chef Roberth Sundell, rated among the top 100 restaurants in the Bay Area by SF Chronicle. He founded FishInKitchen, his own workshop classes where he brings people out on fishing trips and teaches how to clean and cook their own catches.
