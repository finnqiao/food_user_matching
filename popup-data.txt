My love for cooking started at a young age in my motherland of Iran, when I used to watch my mom cook for our family of six and endless more guests! She taught me to cook with passion and educate myself about the healing power of food and herbs. To this day, healthy eating habits play an important role in my cooking and personal lifestyle. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a beautiful tradition at home of making our own delicate pastries for the Persian New Year, Nowruz, marking the first day of Spring. Family and friends simply loved it, and we loved spreading the joy! I\\u2019ve had the chance to explore and share my cooking and baking skills since then. When I was 16, I volunteered to help raise money by hand-making high quality sweets and treats for charities and non-profit organizations. I always enjoyed doing such projects alongside my studies and work, especially for a good cause. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy style of cooking is influenced as much by my Persian roots as my travels in other countries. I\\u2019ve had the pleasure of exploring different cuisines during trips across Europe, such as in Paris where I took classes at the Cordon Bleu. I believe travel, people and food open doors to different cultures and I truly feel lucky to be able to experience that endless journey of discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiving in San Francisco has been yet another fantastic experience. With a professional background in computer Eng. and business, I\\u2019ve worked with high tech startups here in the Bay Area, mainly dealing with technology gadgets like augmented reality glasses and product management. I enjoy extensive knowledge about branding and advertising from my time working and studying in Dubai, a global melting pot, which also opened many doors for me to Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\u2019m excited above all to share the fruits of my global cooking adventures with you, including unique culinary gems of my beloved Iran. \\r\\n\\r\\nNoosh e joon.

My love for cooking started at a young age in my motherland of Iran, when I used to watch my mom cook for our family of six and endless more guests! She taught me to cook with passion and educate myself about the healing power of food and herbs. To this day, healthy eating habits play an important role in my cooking and personal lifestyle. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a beautiful tradition at home of making our own delicate pastries for the Persian New Year, Nowruz, marking the first day of Spring. Family and friends simply loved it, and we loved spreading the joy! I\\u2019ve had the chance to explore and share my cooking and baking skills since then. When I was 16, I volunteered to help raise money by hand-making high quality sweets and treats for charities and non-profit organizations. I always enjoyed doing such projects alongside my studies and work, especially for a good cause. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy style of cooking is influenced as much by my Persian roots as my travels in other countries. I\\u2019ve had the pleasure of exploring different cuisines during trips across Europe, such as in Paris where I took classes at the Cordon Bleu. I believe travel, people and food open doors to different cultures and I truly feel lucky to be able to experience that endless journey of discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiving in San Francisco has been yet another fantastic experience. With a professional background in computer Eng. and business, I\\u2019ve worked with high tech startups here in the Bay Area, mainly dealing with technology gadgets like augmented reality glasses and product management. I enjoy extensive knowledge about branding and advertising from my time working and studying in Dubai, a global melting pot, which also opened many doors for me to Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\u2019m excited above all to share the fruits of my global cooking adventures with you, including unique culinary gems of my beloved Iran. \\r\\n\\r\\nNoosh e joon.

Pomegranates, as well as the thick-skinned, sour citrus fruit Narenj, are reduced down to make tart, concentrated molasses that impart bright flavor to Gilaki dishes.\\r\\nI recently finished the video shooting part of an amazing cooking documentary project about Gilaki cuisine.
