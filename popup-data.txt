Northern Iran's lush, humid climate allows crops such as rice, tea, pomegranate and citrus to flourish.

Pomegranates, as well as the thick-skinned, sour citrus fruit Narenj, are reduced down to make tart, concentrated molasses that impart bright flavor to Gilaki dishes.\\r\\nI recently finished the video shooting part of an amazing cooking documentary project about Gilaki cuisine.
