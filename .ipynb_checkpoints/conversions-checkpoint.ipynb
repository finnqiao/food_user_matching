Julienne Style French Fries Garlic-Parmesan Fries Garlic Cheese Fries Cheesesteak Fries Entrees The classic using your choice of grilled ribeye steak or chicken. Made with grilled onions, hot and sweet peppers (up to you). Entrees Bringing that Hawaiian twist to the cheesesteak, we use grilled onions, mushrooms, provolone cheese, gravy, and finish it off with an egg on top. Entrees This idea came about after one of those late nights on the truck when we needed some munchies. It's made with grilled onions, mushrooms, bourbon sauce, and topped with Chili Cheese Fritos. Entrees If you like cheese, then this one's for you. Provolone cheese... Check. White-American cheese... Check. Cheez-Whiz... Check. Oh yeah, it also has grilled onions. Entrees This is our signature cheesesteak you will crave for.  White-American cheese, grilled onions, roasted garlic & mushrooms. Entrees This one is just like the Classic but has an extra kick of our horseradish sauce and a side of Au Jus. Entrees Made with grilled onions, cheese, and topped with creamy Sriracha sauce that gives it a karate “cha”p.  Hi-ya! Entrees Your choice of ribeye steak or chicken with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo. Entrees Cheese grilled onions, topped with pico de gallo and a cilantro-cotija crema. After this you'll be saying Muy Bueno! Entrees This vegetarian cheesesteak is so good, even carnivores like it.  It’s made with quinoa and beans for the base, along with some special spices to give it a great taste. Have it as one of the cheesesteaks listed above. Sides  Sides  Sides Using Whiz of course! Sides The Classic over fries! Gluten friendly!\",\n",
