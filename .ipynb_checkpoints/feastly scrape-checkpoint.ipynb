       "  'chef-info': '\"People who love to eat are always the best people\" ~ Julia Child\\r\\n\\r\\nSalam! My love for cooking started at a young age in my motherland of Iran, when I used to watch my mom cook for our family of six and endless more guests! She taught me to cook with passion and educate myself about the healing power of food and herbs. To this day, healthy eating habits play an important role in my cooking and personal lifestyle. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a beautiful tradition at home of making our own delicate pastries for the Persian New Year, Nowruz, marking the first day of Spring. Family and friends simply loved it, and we loved spreading the joy! I’ve had the chance to explore and share my cooking and baking skills since then. When I was 16, I volunteered to help raise money by hand-making high quality sweets and treats for charities and non-profit organizations. I always enjoyed doing such projects alongside my studies and work, especially for a good cause. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy style of cooking is influenced as much by my Persian roots as my travels in other countries. I’ve had the pleasure of exploring different cuisines during trips across Europe, such as in Paris where I took classes at the Cordon Bleu. I believe travel, people and food open doors to different cultures and I truly feel lucky to be able to experience that endless journey of discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiving in San Francisco has been yet another fantastic experience. With a professional background in computer Eng. and business, I’ve worked with high tech startups here in the Bay Area, mainly dealing with technology gadgets like augmented reality glasses and product management. I enjoy extensive knowledge about branding and advertising from my time working and studying in Dubai, a global melting pot, which also opened many doors for me to Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m excited above all to share the fruits of my global cooking adventures with you, including unique culinary gems of my beloved Iran. \\r\\n\\r\\nNoosh e joon. Enjoy. Bon appetit. Sahtein  \\r\\n\\r\\nSeti Shay \\r\\nPetite girl with a big appetite.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow my journey on IG: @setistable',\n",

       "  'chef-info': 'With 20 years under his apron, Geoffrey Reed owes much of his culinary awareness to the ocean and mountains that surrounded him as a native of McKinleyville, California. It began early on in his parent’s garden, fishing in the creek behind the house and having full reign to play in the kitchen. Geoff got his first taste of the culinary life at 12, helping with chocolate dipped strawberries and washing dishes on Valentine’s Day at a restaurant where his older brother worked. That adventure turned into a career of working his way through every position in the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in San Francisco, Geoff has worked numerous restaurant openings including Pläj with Executive Chef Roberth Sundell, rated among the top 100 restaurants in the Bay Area by SF Chronicle. He founded FishInKitchen, his own workshop classes where he brings people out on fishing trips and teaches how to clean and cook their own catches. Now with Feastly, he hosts his own series of omakase pop-ups which feature his one-of-a-kind recipes from the fresh seafood he catches and local foraged ingredients in the Bay Area.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more about Geoff on the Feastly Blog: http://bit.ly/1NvrFlD',\n",
